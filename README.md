# Experimental QDS-inspired toolkit for Raspberry Pi & Pico devices

This project is inspired by the **Quantum Dark Substrate (QDS)** framework, exploring stochastic vacuum substrate effects on Raspberry Pi and Pico devices.

## Features
- Placeholder scripts for QDS-inspired experiments
- Examples for Pico/RP2040 or full Raspberry Pi boards
- Ready for expansion and community contribution

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danfromdursley-spec/QDS-Pi-Toolkit.git
cd QDS-Pi-Toolkit
